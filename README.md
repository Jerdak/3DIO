3DIO
====

The 3D input/output library has temporarily been cleared out.  The original library was based off of work I did as a freshman in college and continued well in to my career.  

As an alternative, Matt Fisher of Stanford [maintains a very nice collection](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/MarchingCubes.html) of custom 3D tools that support his research efforts.  You can find his entire engine packaged at the bottom of his MarchingCubes project.  

You could also modify most of my code to adopt [Ogre3D's SDK](http://www.ogre3d.org/).  The changes would be minimal.
